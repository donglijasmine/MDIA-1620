19 SEP 2024 LAB 3 ASSIGNMENT

WEEK 3 LEARNINGS - these are edited from file in local computer

3 My "aha" moment is

>1. git clone creates a copy of a repository to my local computer
>2. git add adds file to a commit
>3. git push pushes local changes to the origin
>4. console.log mean print this text for me
>5. let can create a variable

2 Things that are not clear

>1. let isHungry = true, do you call isHungry a variable? do you call true a boolean?
>2. let age = 20, do you call "age" a variable? do you call 20 a number?
>3. let nameVar = dongli, do you call nameVar a variable? do you call dongli a string?

1 Word for how I am feeling

Learnings from the 3 2 1 
>1. Terminal can be used for quicker access to folders and files
>2. You can use these things on Terminal - cd, ls, cd ..,mkdir,mkdir{folder name},rm -rf{folder name},touch text.pdf etc
>3. When googling answers, we can put mdn for professional answers
>4. You can go to a specific folder or file with the path given. I am waiting for notes of this.

Feedback
> It is difficult for me without any programming knowledge to follow in the first lab. Can Sonja demonstrate each command first, let us try it, and then write notes on the screen, then wait for everyone to write their notes before moving onto the next demonstration of command? That will make it easier for everyone to follow the steps, practice and write down notes to refer to because we won't be able to remember all the small details and functions of the short commands, such as "you need a SPACE before .."


3  My "aha" moment is 
>1. when teacher helped me list the documents on Desktop
>2. none
>3. none
   
2  Things that are still unclear
>1. Can I directly go to a sub folder or a file from Desktop using cd?
>2. Is it cd .. / .. /  --> going back and back?
